September 6th, 1972:
I've been down here for a full week as of today! It's been riveting, fascinating, beautiful- there's a whole world of discovery in this pit. It's hard to stay focused on the stone, but I've discovered enough that the suits upstairs are going to be thrilled for weeks.
First, the stone seems to be running itself off of life magic, the rare, tricky kind. It pulls the life force from all organisms around it, so the suits upstairs will also be thrilled to save the funds from the extraction team. At least for now. I don't know how we could get close enough to use it, but when we figure that out, we could save lives! Life magic has been so temperamental and finicky, we've been claiming it's only a theoretical magic for decades, despite knowing it's out there. This stone- the Soul Stone could make life magic actually usable for the world! Imagine the possibilities...
