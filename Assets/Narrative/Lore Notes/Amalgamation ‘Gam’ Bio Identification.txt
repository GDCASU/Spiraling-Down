The Amalgamation's misshapen body reeks of a horrible odor. Its limbs bend in unnatural ways, its sharp, yellowed teeth are always barred to the world, and what is believed to be its face appears to be charred and rotting. Its grotesque nature is only matched by its aggression though. The Amalgamation attacks all that come near. Following its first attack, 'Gam' will dash backwards and continue chasing its enemy, adding to its terrifying demeanor. The Overseers initially incorporated The Amalgamation to protect the Soul Stone from any unwanted intruder. They wanted to create an unnerving creature to make accessing the stone nearly impossible.
