It took so much time, so much planning, but I'm here. I know this place, whatever it is, holds the key to saving my family. I won't let you down, Dad, I swear it. My only regret is not giving my own family one last hug; I know my daughter will be heartbroken, and I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for doing this to her, but it must be done. She's strong enough to hold this, but I worry for her heart; she loves so hard, she can't ever lose that light, the world would be far worse without it. 

Once I return... if I return... The first thing I'll do is go to my sweet girl and tell her everything, show her all the love I couldn't give her for so long. My dear Aubrey... I can't wait to see my wonderful, brilliant daughter again. Stay safe, Bree-bree, my little genius...
