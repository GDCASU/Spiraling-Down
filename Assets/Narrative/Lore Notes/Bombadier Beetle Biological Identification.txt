Recovered specimens of the gigantic bombardier beetle have revealed several interesting facts about their physiology. First, despite their emission of violent flames, their outer carapace is highly flammable, as observed by the numerous charred remains found after a bombardier hive has left a part of the forest. Furthermore, these recoveries show that the beetles do not feel a sense of loyalty like a standard hive mind, rather appearing to be quite willing to leave behind weaker members. This innate sense of "Only the strong survive" is logical given the very reason they use their flames: To set kilometers of their forest habitat ablaze, swooping from the air to bite and sting prey fleeing from the apocalyptic inferno. It is unwise to encounter one of these insects, much less a group, without proper protective materials and a lot of luck.
