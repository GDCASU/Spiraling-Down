September 13th, 1977: 
Corruption. If nothing else gets out from me over this wretched organization, I want it known that the Overseers are CORRUPT! Greedy, vile, helping no one else and nothing else but the further funding, and haphazardly cowardice grasping for more power for themselves! We're testing on living, feeling creatures for a sliver of a shot to control the Soul Stone, which doesn't want to be controlled, and won't be used to help these creatures after! 
I can't be complicit in this anymore.
I can't just walk away, either. I have to stop this. This can't go on any longer, it is my prerogative- no, responsibility to make sure the genetic testing stops. Before these poor creatures live an existence free of content, with only discomfort and struggle and pain. Someone has to do something!
I have to do something. I know exactly what to do...
If there is any god or deity in the universe, I beg not your forgiveness, I don't deserve that. I pray these tortured creatures feel comfort, peace...
