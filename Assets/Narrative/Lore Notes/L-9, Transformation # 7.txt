Subject: L-9
Experiment: L-9 Transformation #7
Description: This experiment tested the use of [ILLEGIBLE] as a method to implant gills into a user to enable the ability to breathe underwater. In order for this to be accomplished, a Test Manager was assigned to use [ILLEGIBLE] such that this test could be performed. The use of [ILLEGIBLE] also resulted in the Subject being unable to breathe using their lungs during the experiment.
Result: FAILURE. Improper function of the gills resulted in the Subject passing out during the experiment. Since the Test Manager was no longer able to use [ILLEGIBLE] in order to remove the gills, they needed to be removed manually in order to restore normal function of the bloodstream and lungs. The Subject's gums were then reattached with precise surgery.
