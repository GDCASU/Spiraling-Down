The Venus Fly Trap's massive size fostered "man-eating" tendencies, increased intelligence, and more aggressive, predator-like behavior. It still retains its sit-and-wait style of hunting, though it is less picky about its food, capable of growing in any direction it seeks. Experiments were performed on the previously "normal-sized" Venus Fly Trap to see if the soul stone's power could be imbued into living creatures. Only an extremely small amount of its power was ever injected into this creature, making this development extraordinarily frightening at the time.
