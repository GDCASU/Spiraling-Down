The Eel Boss demonstrates immense power and strength and its green and slick appearance make it extremely frightening to encounter. This huge monster initially escaped confinement and continues to grow to this day, making it the size of an average bus. The Eel Boss is not only terrifying in size but also terrifying in nature. It shoots lasers and various other projectiles at the player too. Besides the aggressive nature of the Eel Boss on its own, it also summons the Amalgamation (as well as other enemies) when it is threatened.
