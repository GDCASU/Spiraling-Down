While originally observed as standard rats found in many major cities, the introduction of the Soulstone into their environment has caused the rodent populations to develop numerous unique adaptations, including a single eye with increased night vision for hunting, an enlarged size comparable to a husky, and sharp claws to highlight their new position as pack hunters. It has also been observed that some rat packs have formed symbiotic relationships with bands of mushroom creatures in the forest, as eating the mushrooms once they perish has caused the rats to mutate further and become carriers of the fungus. These hypermutants are even more vicious than their standard counterparts and should be treated with extreme caution.
