After months of careful observation and the... unfortunate disappearance of several research assistants, we have discovered the humanoid mushrooms have developed a sort of proto-culture, with makeshift villages and a primitive social structure. Unfortunately, this culture heavily revolves around increasingly violent hunts and defensive patrols of territories. Which have greatly impacted further research near their settlements. Interestingly, their behavior is not limited to outsiders, as groups have been shown to throw out members who either do not pull their weight or attempt to go against the group's culture; in the long-run, this may be a positive for the outcast, as observations have shown that the separation allows them to rapidly develop both in size and intelligence.
