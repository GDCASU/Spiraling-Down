PROMETEO
If I can connect t-t-to the quarks… no, that’d be foolish, absolutely f-f-foolish…

AUBREY
Excuse me, sir-

PROMETEO
AH! It’s you! You’ve come back f-for me! It’s me, your old friend, Prometeo!

AUBREY
I think there’s some sort of mistake sir, I’m afraid I don’t know you. I’m here looking for something, and someone…

PROMETEO
No, that’s impo-po-possible! But… you look…

AUBREY
…

PROMETEO
…Be gone from t-t-this place, before you suffer her f-f-fate.

PROMETEO gives AUBREY the charge.

AUBREY
Thank you, Prometeo-

PROMETEO
Please… l-leave…

PROMETEO
She’d be so proud of you, Aubrey. Angry you w-willingly came into this place, but proud nonetheless.

AUBREY
“She” who? Who is it I remind you of?

PROMETEO
[Insert mother’s name]. I always told her starting a family with [Insert father’s name] was d-d-dangerous in our line of work, but she was determined.

AUBREY
You knew my mother? How? How did you and her end up here?

PROMETEO
C-C-Curiosity. Pure, foolish curiosity. A wonderful blessing, and a d-damnable curse.

PROMETEO
I handpicked her. Was the only one who could actually d-decipher my notes and even cared for our subjects, I was impr-pre-pressed by that. I told her to leave, why didn’t she leave in time…

AUBREY
Prometeo, what did you do?

PROMETEO
…

PROMETEO
Why didn’t she leave in time…
