AUBREY
What are you doing all the way down here? Who are you?

LYNE
I should be asking you that, but if you must know my name, it is Lyne. Now who are you?

AUBREY
I’m... trying to find something. How did you even get down here? Why are you in the water?

LYNE
Fine, keep your secrets. And for your information, I was born down here, this water is all I've ever known.

AUBREY
What is stopping you from just walking out of here?

BREAK

LYNE
Does it make sense now? If I could, I wouldn’t be here dude. I mean look at this place.

AUBREY
Sorry about that. I gotta get going, I’m in a rush.

LYNE
Before you go, take this as a gift.

BREAK

AUBREY
Um... thanks.

END

LYNE
I miss having gills, breathing water through lungs is TERRIBLE!

END

LYNE
What kinds of stuff have you been?

AUBREY
… I don’t know what that means.

END

LYNE
Have you seen Z-7 around lately? He’s my crush. I hope he’s still down here…

END

LYNE
You like to stop and think for a while huh? All you gotta do is move forward!

END

Lyne
You remind me of her… but that’s not possible...
