#SMALL POND - DAY

AUBREY
I never would have guessed that something like this would be down here. All of these strange creatures…

MYSTERIOUS, LOUD VOICE
Stop right there, you who controls magic!

#ELDER MUSHROOM appears from the right on a lilypad. It slowly drifts over to AUBREY.
BREAK

ELDER MUSHROOM
Your kind has destroyed this land for far too– Oh, it’s you– No, no… You’re younger. Not her, but fallen from her tree.

AUBREY
What? 

ELDER MUSHROOM
An apple that falls eventually grows roots, and will become a similar tree.

AUBREY
Are you talking about my father?

ELDER MUSHROOM
This father is unknown. You’re her offspring. You look like her, but with darker eyes.

AUBREY
My mother?

ELDER MUSHROOM
The apple doesn’t fall far when one cuts down the tree. You seek the same thing as her, don’t you?

AUBREY
I’m looking for the Soul Stone. I need it for my father. He’s been sick.

ELDER MUSHROOM
“Soul Stone” you say… Well then, if that’s what you're here for, you’ve come to the right place.

AUBREY
So you know of it?

ELDER MUSHROOM
Why, of course. It lies within the deepest and darkest layers of this domain.

AUBREY
Layers? What’s that supposed to mean?

ELDER MUSHROOM
It does not matter given your lack of knowledge. Your journey is likely hopeless, though I can bestow to you a gift from my people. Take these.

# ELDER MUSHROOM gives AUBREY some Fungal Shards.
BREAK

ELDER MUSHROOM
Now go. Time heals many wounds, but this one is enemies with time.

# Player interacts again

ELDER MUSHROOM
You’re still here? I do not know what else you would want from me. If it is the case that you still want to listen to me, I can offer some advice to aid you on your voyage.

# PLAYER INTERACTS AGAIN
ELDER MUSHROOM
An artist with the best ideas never approaches the canvas.

# PLAYER INTERACTS AGAIN
ELDER MUSHROOM
An apple that falls close to the tree will feed its source.

# PLAYER INTERACTS AGAIN
ELDER MUSHROOM
Ignorance is bliss when you’re in this pit.

# PLAYER INTERACTS AGAIN
ELDER MUSHROOM
Your journey in life isn’t truly over until you start talking to inanimate objects.

# PLAYER INTERACTS AGAIN
ELDER MUSHROOM
All journeys start with either a step or a fall.


# PLAYER INTERACTS AGAIN
ELDER MUSHROOM
If you wish to know more of the one that came before you, I’m afraid I am of no help in that regard… She swore me to secrecy.

# ELDER MUSHROOM repeats this line from here after.
